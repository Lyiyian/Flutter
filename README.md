# flutter_app

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Here will use it to record my study process.

Just some simple usage.

Use true devices:
> Android 
**please run in terminal: flutter config --android-sdk +your android sdk path**

Then you detect your devices and run your app. (gradle will download the corresponding libraries automatically, if you meet something wrong,
please download **SDK Plateform** and **Android SDK Build-Tools** in SDK Manager by yourself)
more detail please see [link](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
